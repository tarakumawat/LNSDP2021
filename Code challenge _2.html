		<h1>I like to go swimming in the summer.</h1>
		<p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer.When the sun is shining <br>and the air is warm.You will find me dipping into my backyard pool.It's not an<br> impressive pool,only three feet deep, but it's mine.
		<br><br>
		There are three reasons I like to swim:
		<ul>
			<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
			<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
			<li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
		</ul>
